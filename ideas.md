## health regeneration: 
5 seconds after not taking damage, heal 25 health per second. 

## for an element system, i was thinking something simple, your element provides just a basic passive, and an ultimate

for example:
## Devine monkey: 
Passive: increase health by 20 points.

Ultimate: nearby allies gain a 30 point health boost, and regenerate 10 health per second. Lasts 10 seconds.


## quantum monkey: 
passive: if standing still/crouching without moving for 3 seconds; become invisible. effect dissipates as soon as you move or fire a weapon.

ultimate: summon a black hole at the location of your crosshair, (up to 5 meters away from you), that sucks enemies in, inflicts enemies that enter the black hole with **superimposed**, and lasts 3 seconds.

**superimposed** : target inflicted with superimposed takes 20% increased damage, and cannot heal. effect lasts 5 seconds.

## Mental:
Passive: Enemies you hit receive **confusion**.
Mental monkeys themselves are immune to **confusion** and **emotional damage**.

**confusion**: monkeys inflicted with confusion can deal damage to their teammates, and can heal enemies. lasts 10 seconds. 

Ultimate: inflicts all enemies in game with **emotional damage**.
**emotional damage**: enemies inflicted with **emotional damage** will view allies as enemies. 

## Infernal monkey:
passive: attacks have a 33% chance of inflicting **scorched** on enemies.
**scorched**: take 7 damage per second DOT. lasts 5 seconds. 

ultimate: float up 5 meters high and become a miniature sun, dealing 0.5 damage per 10 miliseconds (50 damage per second) to enemies within a 10 meter radius, lasting 4 seconds. the ground affected by you then becomes infernal for 5 seconds, inflicting **scorched** on enemies that enter.
