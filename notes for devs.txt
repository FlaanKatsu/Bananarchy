The game source code goes here (that would be the unity project files,) not the release. This game will release as
1. A web client
2. A Linux client (appimage hopefully, it might also release on the AUR)
3. A Windows client

note:
There will be no macOS client for the forseeable future as macOS requires an apple deleoper account (100$ subsciption service to have your programs 
executable on the macOS platform),as well as a mac device that is up to date (apple denies non up to date macs the ability to download 
required development APIs like Xcode, esseintailly requiring us to purchase a new mac device, and thier subscription service.) 
Apple's mac devices are also inherently underpowered, unless opting out for their more expensive pro models.

In the future, an android client is planned. 
(IOS (iPhone and iPad) requires an apple mac device to create the package, and an apple developer subscription; there will be no IOS release.)
(additional note about IOS: the european union has forced apple to allow users proper developer / user install permisions, a IOS release in the EU is a probablility.)
